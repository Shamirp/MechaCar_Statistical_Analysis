## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

•	Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

-The  dependent variables that provided non-random amounts of variance were vehicle length, ground clearance, and AWD. The coefficients for these variables had no exponents which makes the range of values less random than the other variables. 

•	Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

-No, according to the p-value (5.35e-11) there is a significant trend in the data. This p-value is way below the .05 (5 in 100) possibility of no correlation. 

•	Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

-The linear model predicts a moderate to strong strength in correlation based on the r-squared value of .7149. This states that roughly 72% of the time these factors will impact a MechaCars mpg.
